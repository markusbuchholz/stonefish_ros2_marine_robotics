To adapt the conversion for a scenario where your boat is operating within a relatively small local area, like a 10x10 meter grid, and assuming you want a more geographically accurate mapping, we can use a geodetic approach that approximates changes in latitude and longitude based on changes in meters. Given that such a small area can typically be approximated as flat for the purposes of local navigation, you can use a simple method to convert between meters and decimal degrees of latitude and longitude.

Understanding the Conversion:
1 meter of latitude or longitude varies depending on where you are on the Earthâ€™s surface. However, a rough approximation is:

Latitude: Approximately 1 degree of latitude is about 111 kilometers (or 111,000 meters), so 1 meter corresponds to about 1 / 111,000 degrees = 0.000009 degrees.
Longitude: The size of one degree of longitude varies based on the cosine of the latitude. At the equator, it is almost the same as latitude, but it shrinks to zero as you move toward the poles.
Example Conversion for a Specific Location:
Assuming your base location is at 34.5678901 degrees latitude and -120.1234567 degrees longitude, we can set up a function to convert from a local metric coordinate system (where x and y are in meters and represent easting and northing respectively) to geographic coordinates. For the sake of this example, let's assume that this location is in California, USA, which would roughly fall into UTM zone 10N.

The data you've received includes an `EKF_STATUS_REPORT` message, which is directly related to the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) used in many flight control systems for estimating vehicle states, such as position, velocity, and attitude. The EKF fuses various sensor inputs to provide an accurate estimate of the vehicle's state.

### Decoding the `EKF_STATUS_REPORT`

This specific message type provides a status report of the EKF and contains the following fields that are of interest:

- **`flags`**: Status flags that may indicate sensor health, estimator status, etc.
- **`velocity_variance`**: Variance of the velocity estimate.
- **`pos_horiz_variance`**: Variance of the horizontal position estimate.
- **`pos_vert_variance`**: Variance of the vertical position estimate.
- **`compass_variance`**: Variance of the compass estimate.
- **`terrain_alt_variance`**: Variance of the terrain altitude estimate.

From the data snippet you posted:

```json
'EKF_STATUS_REPORT': {
    'mavpackettype': 'EKF_STATUS_REPORT', 
    'flags': 167, 
    'velocity_variance': 0.0, 
    'pos_horiz_variance': 0.0007590136374346912, 
    'pos_vert_variance': 0.002602876629680395, 
    'compass_variance': 0.0, 
    'terrain_alt_variance': 0.0, 
    'airspeed_variance': 0.0
}
```

### Interpreting the Data

- **`flags` (167)**: This is a bitmask where each bit represents a different status or health of the estimator. For instance, if a bit for GPS fix is set, it would mean the estimator considers the GPS data reliable.
- **`pos_horiz_variance` and `pos_vert_variance`**: These values represent the estimated uncertainty in the horizontal and vertical position measurements from the EKF. The variances are small (0.000759 for horizontal and 0.002603 for vertical), indicating relatively high confidence in these estimates.

### Conclusion

Given the presence of the `EKF_STATUS_REPORT` message and the content within it, it's clear that the data you're receiving includes estimated vehicle states that have been processed through an EKF. The small variances in position indicate good confidence in these estimates, assuming that other aspects of the flight control system are functioning normally.

The EKF typically combines inputs from GPS, inertial measurement units (IMUs), and other sensors to produce these estimates, making it a crucial component for accurate navigation and control in GPS-denied environments or when precise movement control is necessary.

If you need to further analyze the EKF behavior or diagnose issues, monitoring these variances over time, along with flags and other system statuses like those in the `SYS_STATUS` or `VIBRATION` reports, would be essential. This can help in understanding how different flight conditions or environmental factors affect the accuracy and reliability of the state estimates provided by the EKF.
