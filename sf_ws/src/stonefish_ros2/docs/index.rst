Stonefish: an advanced simulation tool developed for marine robotics
====================================================================

`Stonefish <https://github.com/patrykcieslak/stonefish>`_ is a C++ library combining a physics engine and a lightweight rendering pipeline. The physics engine is based on the core functionality of the `Bullet Physics <https://pybullet.org>`_ library, extended to deliver realistic simulation of marine robots. It is directed towards researchers in the field of marine robotics but can as well be used as a general purpose robot simulator.

*Stonefish* includes advanced hydrodynamics computation based on actual geometry of bodies to better approximate hydrodynamic forces and allow for effects not possible when using symbolic models. The rendering pipeline, developed from the ground up, delivers realistic rendering of atmosphere, ocean and underwater environment. Special focus was put on the latter, where effects of wavelength-dependent light absorption and scattering were considered.

*Stonefish* library can be used to create custom standalone simulators or combined with a `Robot Operating System (ROS) <https://www.ros.org>`_ package, called `stonefish_ros2 <https://github.com/patrykcieslak/stonefish_ros2>`_, which delivers a convenient way to use the *Stonefish* potential in a ROS2-oriented environment.

ROS2 package for Stonefish
==========================

The *stonefish_ros2* package delivers an implementation of a standard simulator node. The standard simulator is a graphical type simulator, which loads the description of the simulation scenario from an XML file. 

The syntax of the scenario description files is explained in detail in the *Stonefish* library documentation. The *stonefish_ros2* package extends this syntax, to include ROS2 specific definitions, through subclassing of the original XML parser class. The new parser is able to support finding files in other ROS2 packages, parsing parameters, as well as creating necessary publishers, subscribers and services automatically.

After the simulation scenario is constructed based on the description, the simulation automatically starts.
With each simulation step, the readings of the selected sensors are published using appropriate ROS2 topics and the setpoints of the robots' actuators are updated based on incoming ROS2 messages. The sensor publishing is defined through a set of functions, constituting a *Stonefish*-ROS2 interface. Moreover, some functions of the library are exposed through services.

Support
=======
I offer paid support on setting up the simulation of your own systems, including necessary 3D modelling (simplification of CAD models for physics, preparation of accurate visualisations, etc.), setup of simulation scenarios, development of new sensors, actuators, and custom features that do not require significant changes to the code base.
